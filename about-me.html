			This looks like a wall of text, and it is, but bear with me, because I've tried to add some pictures and interactive bits wherever I can. Promise. I mean, even just looking at this main bit shows a ton of purple, a lot of links to click. I tried to make this interesting, honest.
			<br><br>
			So, my real name is Michael Antonio Tronnolone. I am a 17 year old programmer and life-long gamer from Watford, United Kingdom. It's a smaller town on the edge of London. This is me:

			Well, it's not me, but it's what I choose to look like online. I'm a little worried about putting my face out their publicly. Maybe I'll do it one day.
			<br><br>
			So I code. I code quite a bit. It's a real passion of mine. I've done a little Minecraft modding, I've learned Python in school and, of course, done a bit of HTML and CSS. That's literally how you're seeing this site, after all. Also I'm a gamer. I play lots of games. <u><b>LOTS</b></u> of games. If you wanna hit me up on almost every gaming platform, I'm TheCyberTronn. <a href="http://thecybertronn.github.io/TCT/contact-me">(Get direct links here)</a> So, what games do I like? Well...

		<ul>
			<li><a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/570/">Dota 2</a></li>
			<li><a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/440/">Team Fortress 2</a></li>
			<li><a href="http://us.battle.net/hearthstone/en/">Hearthstone</a></li>
		</ul>

			So I used to do YouTube. That was fun while it lasted. Got some decent videos, decent views on those videos. I peaked at about 280 subscribers. I might start up again eventually, when I get to upgrade my hardware. If you want to peruse at the past, <a href ="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoZEcfDFpc4Q6UD6qJ94CPg">you can do so here</a>. You never know, I may have uploaded some newer videos since I wrote this, who knows? You will. You'll know if you click that link. If you do, feel free to subscribe, though.
			<br><br>
			Lets talk about moderating positions. I've done a little bit of moderating in my past. For the summer of 2014, I was a Jr Helper on the <a href="http://www.hypixel.net">Hypixel Minecraft server</a>. It was quite fun, honestly. I'd love to do some kind of moderation somewhere again, be it in Minecraft or not.
			<br><br>
			I've done a little bit of quality assurance for software too. I've visited <a href="http://www.wiredproductions.com/">Wired Productions'</a> office to play their game <a href="http://www.superdungeonbros.com/">Super Dungeon Bros</a> as it was in early beta in late July and August of 2015. During my time there, I found around a hundred individual bugs in the software and most of them were fixed before I left to continue with my studies in September.
