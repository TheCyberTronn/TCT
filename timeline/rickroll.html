			[Verse 1]<br>
			We're no strangers to love<br>
			You know the rules and so do I<br>
			A full commitment's what I'm thinking of<br>
			You wouldn't get this from any other guy<br>
			<br>
			[Pre-Chorus]<br>
			I just wanna tell you how I'm feeling<br>
			Gotta make you understand<br>
			[Chorus]<br>
			Never gonna give you up<br>
			Never gonna let you down<br>
			Never gonna run around and desert you<br>
			Never gonna make you cry<br>
			Never gonna say goodbye<br>
			Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you<br>
			<br>
			[Verse 2]<br>
			We've known each other for so long<br>
			Your heart's been aching but you're too shy to say it<br>
			Inside we both know what's been going on<br>
			We know the game and we're gonna play it<br>
			<br>
			[Pre-Chorus]<br>
			And if you ask me how I'm feeling<br>
			Don't tell me you're too blind to see<br>
			<br>
			[Chorus]<br>
			Never gonna give you up<br>
			Never gonna let you down<br>
			Never gonna run around and desert you<br>
			Never gonna make you cry<br>
			Never gonna say goodbye<br>
			Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you<br>
			<br>
			[Bridge]<br>
			(Ooh give you up)<br>
			(Ooh give you up)<br>
			(Ooh) never gonna give, never gonna give<br>
			(give you up)<br>
			(Ooh) never gonna give, never gonna give<br>
			(give you up)<br>
